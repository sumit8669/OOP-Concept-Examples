# OOP-Concept-Examples

This repository contains examples of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in various programming languages.

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. OOP focuses on encapsulating data and behavior together into objects, promoting modular and reusable code.

The examples in this repository cover some of the fundamental concepts of OOP, including:

Classes and Objects: the building blocks of OOP. A class defines a blueprint for an object, while an object is an instance of a class.
Inheritance: a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class, allowing for code reuse and creating a hierarchical structure of classes.
Polymorphism: the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, method overriding, and interface implementation.
Encapsulation: the idea of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, keeping the implementation details hidden from outside interference.
The examples in this repository are written in various programming languages, including Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript. Each example includes a brief explanation of the OOP concept being demonstrated, along with sample code that illustrates how the concept can be implemented in the respective programming language.

Feel free to explore the examples and use them as a reference or starting point for your own OOP projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
